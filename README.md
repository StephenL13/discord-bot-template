# Discord.js v13 Bot Template
Hey everyone! This is what I regularly use for further reference to the bots I create. The `config.json` file is provided for fields to edit the code (e.g.: prefix) except bot tokens reserved via `.env` file. Included in this repository are the command and event handlers plus a free HTTP server to run and monitor using UptimeBot or BetterUptime (applicable for Replit users).

If you have questions, comments, or concerns, you may post on the Issues tab or [visit my support server.](https://discord.gg/ghN4SzhJTB)

Regards and wishes,</br>Stephen L.

[A huge thanks to UltraX's tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcF1sOaHvEI) for this idea on the handlers.

To start developing, you need the following prerequisite libraries to install via NPM:
- Node v16 LTS
- Discord.js v13
- dotenv
- fs

To create a bot account, visit https://discord.com/developers/applications. Click "New Application" and name it as you wish and click "Bot" with the jigsaw puzzle icon. On the Build-A-Bot section, click "Add Bot" and confirm to the changes. Copy the token and obtain it on your `.env` file. You must enable all the intents to be used to run the bot. Go to OAuth2 and URL Generator then choose `bot`, `applications.commands`, and your desired permissions. Copy the generated URL and invite the bot into your testing server.

To setup your bot, open your terminal and execute `npm init` to start creating the Node app environment.
<br>Then, run `npm install discord.js dotenv fs`.

## INSIDE THE PREFIXED COMMAND HANDLER
The folder is labeled `./commands` but require sub-folders to keep the bot structure organized. `module.exports.run` is where you can place all of the code you need. The latter is `module.exports.help`, which is where you modify the official command name and aliases.
```js
module.exports.run = async(client, message, args, prefix) => {
    await message.reply({ content: "This is a template test for the command handler." })
}

module.exports.help = {
    name: "test",
    aliases: []
}
```

## INSIDE THE SLASH COMMAND HANDLER
Discord welcomes the use of slash commands in our bots today, which was [introduced at around 25th of March](https://blog.discord.com/slash-commands-are-here-8db0a385d9e6).

However, the slash command data (`./dataHandler.js`) is in a form of JSON style. By this case, be sure to refer to [Discord API's documentation page]('https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands').
```js
async function createCmd(client, guildId) {
    const data = [
        {
            name: "test",
            description: "Serves a bot test run"
        }
    ]
    
    // You can comment out which do you want to distribute your slash commands.
    await client.guilds.cache.get(guildId)?.commands.set(data) // Server-exclusive
    await client.application?.commands.set(data) // Globally (perfect for public bots)
}

module.exports = { createCmd }
```
On `./events/ready.js`, you have to type the following code after selecting which slash command distribution method:
```js
const client = require('../index.js').client;
const { createCmd } = require('../dataHandler')
client.on('ready', () => {
    console.log('Hello! The bot is now ready.')
    createCmd(client)
    // or...
    createCmd(client, "serverid")
})
```
Finally, on `./slashcommands`, this is where we the file listens to the data handler to execute an event.
```js
module.exports.run = async(client, interaction) => {
    await interaction.reply({ content: `This is a template test for the command handler.`, ephemeral: true })
}

module.exports.help = {
    name: "test"
}
```

## INSIDE THE EVENT HANDLER
```js
const client = require('../index.js').client; // Requires the client handler from the index file

client.on('anyDiscordEvent', () => {
    console.log("I keep the transparency of your bot's undertakings.")
})
```

## ADDENUM
**Q:** Why there is a developerID field on `./config.json`?
</br>**A:** This is helpful for most developers who wish to keep their currently developing code in a private state. This should work on both prefixed and slash command handlers. Please see the `template.js` files on each of the commmand handler folders.

**Q:** How do I change my bot intents?
<br>**A:** By default, it is '32767' aka. total access to all bot permissions. That can be changeable within the `index.js` folder.

**Q:** I want my bot to run on Replit. How should I use this?
</br>**A:** Fork the repository. Log-in or signup to Replit afterwards. At the homepage, click the `+` icon and select Node.js. You must create the repl folder first. Then use the shell terminal to execute `git clone https://github.com/<Github username>/<forked repo name>.git`. Finally, move all of the necessary files to the root folder including `.git` (of your forked repo!) for version control purposes.

**Q:** My music bot that uses Opusscript cannot run! (Replit users)
</br>**A:** Run `npm i --python=python3.10`

**Q:** Will this be useable on TypeScript?
</br> **A:** No. However, I can make a separate version utilizing the same bot framework library with superset usage.
